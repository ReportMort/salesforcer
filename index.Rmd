**salesforcer** is an R package that connects to Salesforce APIs using tidy principles. 
The package implements most actions from the following APIs:
 
 - REST
 - Bulk (2.0 for insert, delete, update, and upsert; 1.0 for query and hardDelete)
 - SOAP 

Future APIs to support: 

 - Async
 - Metadata
 - Reporting
 - Analytics

Package features include: 

  * OAuth 2.0 and Basic authentication methods (`sf_auth()`)
  * CRUD operations (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) methods for REST and Bulk APIs 
  * Query operations via REST and Bulk APIs (`sf_query()`)
  * Backwards compatible functions from the **RForcecom** package (`rforcecom.login()`, 
  `rforcecom.query()`)
  * Basic utility calls (`sf_user_info()`, `sf_server_timestamp()`, `sf_list_objects()`)

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# this package is currently not on CRAN, so it should be installed from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("StevenMMortimer/salesforcer")
```

If you encounter a clear bug, please file a minimal reproducible example on [github](https://github.com/StevenMMortimer/salesforcer/issues).

## Usage

### Using against the REST API

```{r, message = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(salesforcer)

sf_auth()

# pull down information of person logged in
# it's a simple easy call to get started 
# and confirm a connection to the APIs
user_info <- sf_user_info()

# Create some records

# Now query those records by Id
my_soql <- sprintf("SELECT Id, 
                           Account.Name, 
                           FirstName, 
                           LastName 
                    FROM Contact 
                    WHERE Id in ('%s')", 
                   paste0(created_records$id , collapse="','"))

queried_records <- sf_query(my_soql)

# Update some of those records
queried_records <- queried_records %>%
  mutate(FirstName = "TestTest")

updated_records <- sf_update(queried_records)

# Finally delete those records
deleted_records <- sf_delete(updated_records$id)
```

### Using against the Bulk API

```{r, message = FALSE, eval=FALSE}

# For really large inserts, updates, deletes, upserts, queries 
# you can just add "api_type" = "Bulk" to most functions to get 
# the benefits of using the Bulk API instead of the REST API (fewer calls, speedier)
# create bulk
# delete bulk
# query bulk

```

### Accessing Metadata

In future iterations of the package **salesforcer** will connect to the Metadata API; 
however, currently, there are RESTful calls that will return metatdata.

```{r, message = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
#sf_describe_global()
#sf_describe_object()
#sf_describe_layout()
#sf_describe_tabs()
```

## Credits

This application uses other open source software components. The authentication 
components are mostly verbatim copies of the routines established in the **googlesheets** 
package (https://github.com/jennybc/googlesheets). Methods are inspired by the 
**RForcecom** package (https://github.com/hiratake55/RForcecom). We acknowledge 
and are grateful to these developers for their contributions to open source.
