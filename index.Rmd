**salesforcer** is an R package that connects to Salesforce Platform APIs using 
tidy principles. The package implements most actions from the SOAP, REST, Bulk, 
and Metadata APIs. Package features include: 

  * OAuth 2.0 and Basic authentication methods (`sf_auth()`)
  * CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) methods for records using the REST and Bulk APIs 
  * Query records via REST and Bulk APIs (`sf_query()`)
  * Retrieve and modify metadata (Custom Objects, Fields, etc.) using the Metadata API with: 
    * `sf_describe_objects()`, `sf_create_metadata()`, `sf_update_metadata()`
  * Utilize backwards compatible functions for the **RForcecom** package, such as: 
    * `rforcecom.login()`, `rforcecom.query()`, `rforcecom.create()`, `rforcecom.update()`
  * Basic utility calls (`sf_user_info()`, `sf_server_timestamp()`, `sf_list_objects()`)

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# this package is currently not on CRAN, so it should be installed from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("StevenMMortimer/salesforcer")
```

If you encounter a clear bug, please file a minimal reproducible example on [GitHub](https://github.com/StevenMMortimer/salesforcer/issues).

## Usage

### Authenticate

First, load the **salesforcer** package and login. There are two ways to authenticate:  

  1. OAuth 2.0
  2. Basic Username-Password

It is recommended to use OAuth 2.0 so that passwords do not have to be shared or 
embedded within scripts. User credentials will be stored in locally cached file 
entitled ".httr-oauth-salesforcer" in the current working directory.

```{r auth, include = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(salesforcer)
token_path <- file.path("..", "tests", "testthat", "salesforcer_token.rds")
suppressMessages(sf_auth(token = token_path, verbose = FALSE))
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(dplyr)))
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(purrr)))
library(salesforcer)

# Using OAuth 2.0 authentication
sf_auth()

# Using Basic Username-Password authentication
sf_auth(username = "test@gmail.com", 
        password = "{PASSWORD_HERE}",
        security_token = "{SECURITY_TOKEN_HERE}")
```

After logging in with `sf_auth()`, you can check your connectivity by looking at 
the information returned about the current user. It should be information about you!

```{r}
# pull down information of person logged in
# it's a simple easy call to get started 
# and confirm a connection to the APIs
user_info <- sf_user_info()
sprintf("User Id: %s", user_info$id)
sprintf("User Active?: %s", user_info$isActive)
```

### Create

Salesforce has objects and those objects contain records. One default object is the 
"Contact" object. This example shows how to create two records in the Contact object.

```{r create-records}
n <- 2
new_contacts <- tibble(FirstName = rep("Test", n),
                       LastName = paste0("Contact-Create-", 1:n))
created_records <- sf_create(new_contacts, object_name="Contact")
created_records
```

### Query

Salesforce has proprietary form of SQL called SOQL (Salesforce Object Query 
Language). SOQL is a powerful tool that allows you to return the attributes of records 
on almost any object in Salesforce including Accounts, Contacts, Tasks, Opportunities, 
even Attachments! Below is an example where we grab the data we just created 
including Account object information for which the Contact record is associated 
with. The Account column is all `NA` since we have yet to provide information to 
link these Contacts with Accounts.

```{r query-records}
my_soql <- sprintf("SELECT Id, 
                           Account.Name, 
                           FirstName, 
                           LastName 
                    FROM Contact 
                    WHERE Id in ('%s')", 
                   paste0(created_records$id , collapse="','"))

queried_records <- sf_query(my_soql)
queried_records
```

### Update

After creating records you can update them using `sf_update()`. Updating a record 
requires you to pass the Salesforce `Id` of the record. Salesforce creates a unique 
18-character identifier on each record and uses that to know which record to 
attach the update information you provide. Simply include a field or column in your 
update dataset called "Id" and the information will be matched. Here is an example 
where we update each of the records we created earlier with a new first name 
called "TestTest".

```{r update-records}
# Update some of those records
queried_records <- queried_records %>%
  mutate(FirstName = "TestTest") %>% 
  select(-Account)

updated_records <- sf_update(queried_records, object_name="Contact")
updated_records
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
deleted_records <- sf_delete(updated_records$id)
deleted_records
```

### Bulk Operations

For really large operations (inserts, updates, upserts, deletes, and queries) Salesforce 
provides a [Bulk API](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_asynch.meta/api_asynch/asynch_api_intro.htm). In order to use the Bulk API in **salesforcer** you can just add 
`api_type = "Bulk"` to your functions and the operation will be executed using the Bulk API. 
It's that simple. The benefits of using the Bulk API for larger datasets is that 
the operation will reduce the number of individual API calls (organization usually 
have a limit on total calls) and batching the requests in Bulk is usually quicker 
than running thousands of individuals calls when your data is large.

```{r}
# create contacts using the Bulk API
n <- 2
new_contacts <- tibble(FirstName = rep("Test", n),
                       LastName = paste0("Contact-Create-", 1:n))
created_records <- sf_create(new_contacts, object_name="Contact", api_type="Bulk")

# query large recordsets using the Bulk API
my_soql <- sprintf("SELECT Id,
                           FirstName, 
                           LastName
                    FROM Contact 
                    WHERE Id in ('%s')", 
                   paste0(created_records$successfulResults$sf__Id , collapse="','"))

queried_records <- sf_query(my_soql, object_name="Contact", api_type="Bulk")

# delete these records using the Bulk API
deleted_records <- sf_delete(queried_records$Id, object_name="Contact", api_type="Bulk")
```

### Using the Metadata API

Salesforce is a very flexible platform. Salesforce provides the 
[Metadata API](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_meta.meta/api_meta/meta_intro.htm) 
for users to create, read, update and delete the objects, page layouts, and more. 
This makes it very easy to programmatically setup and teardown the Salesforce 
environment. One common use case for the Metadata API is retrieving information 
about an object (fields, permissions, etc.). You can use the `sf_read_metadata()` 
function to return a list of objects and their metadata. In the example below we 
retrieve the metadata for the Account and Contact objects. Note that the `metadata_type` 
argument is "CustomObject". Standard Objects are an implementation of CustomObjects, 
so they are returned using that metadata type.

```{r metadata-read}
read_obj_result <- sf_read_metadata(metadata_type='CustomObject',
                                    object_names=c('Account', 'Contact'))
read_obj_result[[1]][c('fullName', 'label', 'sharingModel', 'enableHistory')]
first_two_fields_idx <- head(which(names(read_obj_result[[1]]) == 'fields'), 2)
# show the first two returned fields of the Account object
read_obj_result[[1]][first_two_fields_idx]
```

The data is returned as a list because object definitions are highly nested representations. 
You may notice that we are missing some really specific details, such as, the picklist 
values of a field with type "Picklist". You can get that information using the function 
`sf_describe_object()` function which is actually part of the REST and SOAP APIs. 
It is recommended that you try out the various metadata functions `sf_read_metadata()`, 
`sf_list_metadata()`, `sf_describe_metadata()`, and `sf_describe_objects()` in order 
to see which information best suits your use case.

```{r rest-describe-objects}
describe_obj_result <- sf_describe_objects(object_names=c('Account', 'Contact'))
describe_obj_result[[1]][c('label', 'queryable')]
# show the first two returned fields of the Account object
the_type_field <- describe_obj_result[[1]][[58]]
the_type_field$name
map_df(the_type_field[which(names(the_type_field) == "picklistValues")], as_tibble)
```

Where the Metadata API really shines is when it comes to CRUD operations on metadata. 
In this example we will create an object, add fields to it, then delete that object.

```{r metadata-crud}
# create an object
base_obj_name <- "Custom_Account1"
custom_object <- list()
custom_object$fullName <- paste0(base_obj_name, "__c")
custom_object$label <- paste0(gsub("_", " ", base_obj_name))
custom_object$pluralLabel <- paste0(base_obj_name, "s")
custom_object$nameField <- list(displayFormat = 'AN-{0000}', 
                                label = paste0(base_obj_name, ' Number'), 
                                type = 'AutoNumber')
custom_object$deploymentStatus <- 'Deployed'
custom_object$sharingModel <- 'ReadWrite'
custom_object$enableActivities <- 'true'
custom_object$description <- paste0(base_obj_name, " created by the Metadata API")
custom_object_result <- sf_create_metadata(metadata_type = 'CustomObject',
                                           metadata = custom_object)

# add fields to the object
custom_fields <- tibble(fullName=c(paste0(base_obj_name, '__c.CustomField3__c'), 
                                   paste0(base_obj_name, '__c.CustomField4__c')), 
                        label=c('Test Field3', 'Test Field4'), 
                        length=c(100, 100), 
                        type=c('Text', 'Text'))
create_fields_result <- sf_create_metadata(metadata_type = 'CustomField', 
                                           metadata = custom_fields)

# delete the object
deleted_custom_object_result <- sf_delete_metadata(metadata_type = 'CustomObject', 
                                                   object_names = c('Custom_Account1__c'))
```

```{r, include=FALSE, message = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# There are methods as part of the REST API that will return metatdata.
#sf_describe_global()
#sf_describe_object()
#sf_describe_layout()
#sf_describe_tabs()
```

## Future

Future APIs to support: 

 - [Reports and Dashboards REST API](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_analytics.meta/api_analytics/sforce_analytics_rest_api_intro.htm)
 - [Analytics REST API](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.bi_dev_guide_rest.meta/bi_dev_guide_rest/bi_rest_overview.htm)

## Credits

This application uses other open source software components. The authentication 
components are mostly verbatim copies of the routines established in the **googlesheets** 
package (https://github.com/jennybc/googlesheets). We acknowledge and are grateful 
to these developers for their contributions to open source.

## More Information

Salesforce provides client libraries and examples in many programming langauges (Java, 
Python, Ruby, and PhP) but unfortunately R is not a supported language. However, 
most all operations supported by the Salesforce APIs are available via this package. 
This package makes requests best formatted to match what the APIs require as input. 
This articulation is not perfect and continued progress will be made to add and improve 
functionality. For details on formatting, attributes, and methods please refer to 
[Salesforce'sdocumentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/page/Salesforce_APIs) 
as they are explained better there.
