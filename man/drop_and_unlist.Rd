\description{
This function will detect if there are metadata fields returned by the SOAP 
API XML from \code{sf_query} and remove them as well as unlisting (not recursively)
to unnest the record's values. Only tested on two-level child-to-parent relationships. 
For example, for every Contact (child) record return attributes from the 
Account (parent) as well (SOQL = "SELECT Name, Account.Name FROM Contact")
}
