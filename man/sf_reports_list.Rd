\usage{
sf_reports_list(recent = TRUE, as_tbl = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{recent}{\code{logical}; an indicator of whether to return the 200 most
recently viewed reports or to invoke a query on the \code{Report} object to
return all reports in the Org. By default, this argument is set to \code{TRUE}
meaning that only the most recently viewed reports are returned because this
is the default behavior of the reports list endpoint in the Reports and
Dashboards REST API.}

\item{as_tbl}{\code{logical}; an indicator of whether to convert the parsed
JSON into a \code{tbl_df}.}

\item{verbose}{\code{logical}; an indicator of whether to print additional
detail for each API call, which is useful for debugging. More specifically, when
set to \code{TRUE} the URL, header, and body will be printed for each request,
along with additional diagnostic information where available.}
}
\value{
\code{tbl_df} by default, or a \code{list} depending on the value of
argument \code{as_tbl}
}
\description{
\lifecycle{experimental}

Displays a list of up to 200 tabular, matrix, or summary reports that you
recently viewed. To get a full list of reports by format, name, and other
fields, use a SOQL query on the Report object.

This function will only return up to 200 of recently viewed reports. For
a COMPLETE list you must use \code{\link{sf_query}} on the report object.
}

reports_as_list <- sf_reports_list(as_tbl=FALSE)

# to return all possible reports, which is queried from the Report object
