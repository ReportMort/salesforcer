#' @param labels \code{logical}; an indicator of whether the returned data should 
#' be the label (i.e. formatted value) or the actual value. By default, the labels  
#' are returned because these are what appear in the Salesforce dashboard and 
#' more closely align with the column names. For example, "Account.Name" label 
#' may be \code{"Account B"} and the value \code{0016A0000035mJEQAY}. The former 
#' (label) more accurately reflects the "Account.Name".
